Acceptance of Terms</b><br><br>By clicking "Agree" on the account registration or payment page or using the Site in any way, you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by this Agreement, the Privacy Policy and the Expert Agreement, as applicable (collectively "Related Agreements"), and all rules, policies and disclaimers posted on the Site or about which you are notified (collectively "Terms"). If you do not agree with all the Terms, or if you are under the age of eighteen (18), do not use the Site. Please review all of the Terms carefully before using the Site.<br>By using the Site, you (i) agree to be bound by the Terms, (ii) represent that you are over the age of thirteen (13) and able to form legally binding contracts, (iii) agree and acknowledge that by using the Service you are accepting a benefit that cannot be disgorged, (iv) acknowledge that the service is subject to U.S. export controls and agree that you will comply with U.S. export controls, and (v) represent that you are neither located in sanctioned country nor a prohibited person.<br>Please note that these Terms provide that if you and Natural Gurus are unable to resolve any disputes that arise between you and Natural Gurus, the dispute will be resolved by a specific dispute resolution process that may include arbitration. Arbitration is binding and is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You and Natural Gurus also agree that any claims or disputes cannot be brought as a class action..<br>  <br><b>2. Definitions</b><br>  <br>In the Terms, "User," "you" and "your" refer to the individual or entity that creates a Natural Gurus account as a Customer and/or Expert. "Natural Gurus," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Natural Gurus. "Customer" refers to the person who initiates the payment for service. "Expert" refers to the person (or persons) <br>  <br><b>3. Electronic Communications and Right to Modify Terms</b><br>  <br>When you visit Natural Gurus or send us e-mails, you are communicating with us electronically. You consent to receive communications from us electronically. We will communicate with you by e-mail or by posting notices on this Site. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. You agree to provide us with, and maintain in your Natural Gurus account profile, your current and active email address.Natural Gurus may modify any of the Terms at any time by posting them on the Site. Changes shall automatically be effective upon posting; provided, however, that material changes to the Terms will be effective as to an existing User upon the earlier of the agreement of the User or thirty (30) days after notice to the existing User, either via email from info@Natural Gurus.com or another @Natural Gurus.com email address to your email address on file with Natural Gurus or via other means including but not limited to a pop-up or banner, message or other conspicuous notice on the Natural Gurus website. If you affirmatively agree to the new terms, your agreement will be effective immediately. You agree to make any and all necessary arrangements so that you (and not your spam filter) receive all emails from these email addresses. Your continued use of the Service will signify your acceptance of the changes. If you do not accept the changes, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Site. The latest Terms will be posted on the Site, and you should always review them prior to using the Site.<br>  <br><b>4. Natural Gurus Is a Venue; Third-Party Content</b><br>  <br>The Natural Gurus Site is a venue for informational and educational purposes to allow Customers to ask questions and Experts to answer them. Users of the Site, not Natural Gurus, provide the content in Posts (defined below). The Experts determine which questions to answer; Experts are not employees or agents of Natural Gurus but are independent service providers using the Site to sell their Expert knowledge to Customers and, as such, are along with Customers simply Users of the Site. Natural Gurus is not involved in the conversations between Customers and Experts and does not refer Customers to or endorse or recommend particular Experts. You understand and acknowledge that Natural Gurus cannot and does not edit, modify, filter, screen, monitor, endorse or guarantee the content of Posts. Natural Gurus shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of Experts, content in Posts, the ability of Experts to answer questions or the ability of Customers to pay for answers. We cannot ensure that a Customer or Expert will complete a transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Natural Gurus reserves the right, but is not obligated, to refuse to post or to remove any content and/or remove any User\'s access to the Site. EMERGENCY QUESTIONS AND CRISIS SITUATIONS (particularly regarding medical or mental health issues) should be directed immediately by telephone or in-person to qualified professionals (e.g. in the U.S., call 911). The Site is not the appropriate venue to deal with such situations.<br>  <br><b>5. Posts Are Not Private or Confidential; Anonymity</b><br>  <br>The Site is an Internet-based forum (akin to a modern version of a radio call-in program). Information and materials submitted in the content of your questions, answers, requests for information, responses, profiles, signatures, qualifications, comments, and posts in the Expert Forum and other places where Users communicate on the Site (collectively "Posts") is not private or confidential, nor is it protected by attorney-client, doctor-patient, or any other privilege, and it may be read, collected, and used by others. For example, search engines may index your questions, answers, and other Posts to allow them to appear in search engine results (e.g. if someone does a search on google.com or another search engine, your questions, answers, and other Posts on Natural Gurus.com that relate to the search may appear in the search results list). To help protect your privacy, use an anonymous user name and do not include information regarding your identity or contact information in your Posts.<br>  <br><b>6. Verification; No Reliance on the Term "Expert"</b><br>  <br>Every Expert on the Site has had at least one credential relevant to the category in which they are answering questions verified by a third-party verification service, unless the Expert is answering questions in a category that is still being tested by Natural Gurus in "Beta" (indicated by the "Beta" graphic after the category name on the category\'s landing page and/or the URL beginning with www.Natural Gurus.com/lp...). Details regarding the credential(s) verified for each verified Expert can be found by clicking the "What�s This" link next to the "Verified" logo associated with each Expert. Other information about an Expert, not shown as verified, has been provided by the Expert but has not been verified. While Natural Gurus strives to admit only high-quality Experts onto the Site, use of the term "Expert" by Natural Gurus and on the Site is only meant to describe Users who answer questions on the Site, and not to guarantee any particular level of expertise of these Experts.Regarding the verification process, Natural Gurus contracts with third-party service providers to perform the verifications described above; Natural Gurus does not itself verify the credentials of the Experts. The results of the verifications are only as accurate as the information provided to and by the third-party verification services, as of the time of the providing of information to and by the third-party verification services. Natural Gurus makes efforts to verify, including using a third-party identity verification service, but cannot warrant or guarantee an Expert\'s purported identity; user identification on the Internet is difficult. For these reasons, Natural Gurus cannot and does not represent, warrant or guarantee the truthfulness or accuracy of the credentials or identities of and provided by Users including Experts. You acknowledge that Natural Gurus will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on any information or content contained in Posts.<br>  <br><b>7. Information Not Advice; No Client-Professional Relationship</b><br>  <br>Answers of Experts on the Site are provided by Experts and are to be used by Customers for general information purposes only, not as a substitute for in-person evaluation or specific professional (medical, legal, veterinary, tax, financial, etc.) advice. For example, Experts in the Legal category will provide only general information about the law, and will not provide legal advice nor propose a specific course of action for a Customer; by answering questions, Experts do not form attorney-client or doctor-patient relationships with Users of the Site. The laws, regulations, other governing authorities, standards, practices and procedures that apply to your particular question may differ depending on your location and information typically discovered through in-person evaluations or visits. Experts in some categories may be licensed, certified, educated, employed by or have experience in only particular jurisdictions.No professional-client relationships shall be formed on the Site.Communications on this Site are not confidential and shall not be the subject of any associated privileges. Communications on this Site are limited, as described above, do not involve in-person evaluations or visits, and do not include safeguards and procedures typical of in-person evaluations and visits.Before you can interact with an Expert, you will be required to agree to a Disclaimer reminding you of these and other important provisions of the Terms.<br>  <br><b>8. User Accounts; Restricted Activities; Suspension or Termination of Service</b><br>  <br>User Accounts. When you register as a User on the Site, you can establish a user name and password for access to your online account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user name, password and account data, may not share this information or your account with anyone else, and will be solely responsible for all acts or omissions that occur under your account. You will immediately notify Natural Gurus of any unauthorized use of your password or account. You should only create one account on the Site.

Furthermore, you may not resell or make any commercial use of our system or the content on the Site without Natural Gurus\'s prior written consent. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under thirteen years of age, and if we become aware that a child under the age of thirteen (13) has submitted personal information to us, we will promptly remove it from our systems.You are prohibited from soliciting Users of this Site, including Experts, for any purpose (including inviting other Users to contact you off of the Site or inviting Users to participate in a website that competes with Natural Gurus or the Site or charges money to receive answers or to communicate with purported experts or specialists).<br>  <br>Suspension or Termination of Service. You may terminate your service and account at your sole discretion and at any time by written notice via e-mail to info@Natural Gurus.com. Terminations typically will be effective within 7 business days after our receipt of your termination notice, at which time your account will be closed and you will no longer enjoy access to your former account. Any fees accrued as of the effective date of termination will be payable according to the Terms.At any time, without notice, for any or no reason, Natural Gurus reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, to modify and discontinue any portion or all of the Service, and to restrict, suspend and terminate Users� accounts.<br>  <br><b>9. Charges, Rating the Expert, Refund and Cancellation Policy</b><br>  <br>Natural Gurus\'s platform allows Customers to post questions to Experts in subject-matter categories, facilitates communication with Experts via chat, emails and online message boards, and enables delivery of answers to your questions, among other services ("Site Access Benefits"). Customers on the Site may be presented with one of three payment models: (1) pay-per-question model, (2) subscription model, and (3) additional services model (which is explained in Section E below).<br>  <br>If Natural Gurus believes, in its sole discretion, that any funds were earned under suspicious circumstances or that funds were derived from a suspect account, Natural Gurus will continue to investigate the situation until an adequate resolution has been reached, as determined by us, and which may require the involvement of certain third parties, including any applicable credit card company. Natural Gurus will make commercially reasonable efforts not to exceed a ninety-day (90) hold on your account as we and/or a third-party investigate.Natural Gurus maintains the right to initiate special incentive pricing, membership, and other programs. These may be limited, at Natural Gurus�s sole discretion, to defined and limited Users or non-Users. Any promotional monies or credits placed into Customer accounts by Natural Gurus for use towards answers on the Site remain the property of Natural Gurus (they never become the property of Users and never become refundable to the User), and unless otherwise stated on the Site or in an email to a User, will be usable only for thirty (30) days.<br>  <br><b>10.

You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Natural Gurus are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and waiving the right to participate in a class action involving all disputes, claims and controversies, of any sort or nature, between us, arising out of the use of the Site ("Dispute"). You and Natural Gurus agree that any Dispute shall be resolved solely pursuant to the following procedure: (1) notification to the other party of the facts of the Dispute, the legal basis for the Dispute, and all damages claimed, in writing delivered to (a) the User\'s email address on file with Natural Gurus, or (b) Natural Gurus LLC, P.O. Box 29045, San Francisco, CA 94129 or legal@Natural Gurus.com, whichever is applicable ("Dispute Notification"); (2) allowance of thirty (30) days from receipt of the Dispute Notification to receive a response to and/or offer to remedy the Dispute; (3) if the Dispute remains unresolved within those thirty (30) days, the filing of a Request for Online Mediation for Small Claims with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (or Request for Mediation for the minimum of four (4) hours only if the Small Claims limit is exceeded), available online at http://www.aaamediation.com/, with good faith efforts being made to resolve the Dispute during mediation, and the cost of the mediation being born equally by the parties, which cost is currently set at US$50 but may be changed by the AAA; (4) if the mediation does not resolve the Dispute, submission of a Demand for Arbitration with the AAA, see www.adr.org/aaa/faces/services/fileacase/casefiling, in which case the Dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration (by telephone, online and/or solely based on written submissions as chosen by the party initiating the arbitration, as allowed by the AAA Rules and unless otherwise agreed by the parties) or by filing a claim in small claims court. The cost of any arbitration shall be born equally by the parties (except that Natural Gurus may pay the parties\' AAA administrative fees up to US$1000), unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator(s), and the decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be binding and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of arbitration, if the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Natural Gurus�s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Natural Gurus did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Natural Gurus will pay you the amount of the award or US$1000, whichever is greater.<br>  <br>IMPROPERLY SUBMITTED CLAIM. All Disputes must be resolved as set forth above. Disputes filed in a different manner shall be considered improperly filed, and shall entitle Natural Gurus to attorneys� fees and costs up to US$1000, provided that Natural Gurus has notified you in writing (at the email address on file with Natural Gurus will suffice) of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to withdraw the claim promptly.<br>  <br>NO CLASS CLAIMS; WAIVER. YOU AND NATURAL GURUS EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING and that there shall be no class claims, consolidation or joinder allowed in any dispute between the parties, and that no claim may be made through an action purporting to represent a class of Site users or otherwise asserting claims on behalf of a class ("Waiver"). In the event this Waiver is found to be unenforceable, step (4) of the Dispute resolution process, requiring arbitration, shall be voided in its entirety, and the parties may file a complaint in the courts located in San Francisco County, California and agree to waive any and all jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections.This Dispute Resolution section shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your relationship with Natural Gurus.<br>  <br>                           <b>20. Agreement; Assignment; Miscellaneous</b><br>  <br>The Terms constitute the complete and exclusive statement of the Agreement between you and us. It supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreement, oral or written, and any other communications, representations, warranties and understanding relating to the subject matter of the Terms. If there is a conflict between an oral or written representation of any Natural Gurus employee or agent and the Terms (other than modifications to the Terms executed in writing by the CEO or authorized-in-fact representative of Natural Gurus), the Terms will prevail. To the extent the Terms are in conflict or inconsistent with one another, the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy will prevail for Customers, and the Expert Agreement and Privacy Policy will prevail for Experts, over other Terms of the Site; also, this Agreement, Related Agreements and disclaimers will prevail over FAQs, and other rules and policies on the Site. If any provision(s) of the Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision(s) shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties and the other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Natural Gurus�s failure to exercise or enforce any of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of Natural Gurus�s right to exercise or enforce the Terms as to the same or another instance. Headings in this and Related Agreements are for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning of the Terms.You agree that Natural Gurus may assign the Terms to any other entity of its choosing, with or without notice to you. You may not assign the Terms to any other party for any reason, including but not limited to because your interaction with other users of the Site, the pricing offered, and fraud mechanisms in place, are based upon individual usage. Natural Gurus shall not be deemed to have waived any of its rights or remedies unless such waiver is in writing and signed by an officer of Natural Gurus. No delay or omission on the part of Natural Gurus in exercising any rights or remedies shall operate as a waiver of such rights or remedies or any other rights or remedies on future occasions. The section titles in the Terms are solely used for the convenience of the parties and have no legal or contractual significance.<br>  <br>E. Additional Services<br>  <br>You may be presented with an offer for services outside of the Site�s standard question-and-answer platform (�Additional Services�).     Natural Gurus is only a venue which facilitates communication between Experts and potential Users of Additional Services. It does not provide any of the substance or content of any Additional Service initiated through Natural Gurus�s platform. Natural Gurus will in no way be liable for any acts or omissions of Experts in performing Additional Services for you.<br>  <br><b>21. Special Provisions Relating to Remote Desktop Users</b><br>  <br>If you agree to accept Remote Desktop services (whether such services are Information Only or Beyond Information Only) from an Expert, you understand and agree that by accepting such offer for services, you are agreeing to give the Expert full access to and control over your computer (including permission to download and use software on your computer, gather system data, modify settings, etc.) for computer diagnosis, service and repair.  You agree that any third-party software acquired, installed or used during the Remote Desktop session, by you or by the Expert, will be licensed to you, and that any terms of use relating to the third-party software are agreed to by you, that Natural Gurus may record via video the Remote Desktop Session for internal purposes, and that you will not use the Expert�s services to do anything unlawful. <br>  <br><b>22. Special Provisions Relating to Additional Services in the Legal, Medical, Health, Pet, and Large Animal Categories</b><br>  <br>                            Additional Services may be: (1) �Information Only� or (2) �Beyond Information Only�.  �Information Only� Additional Services are those additional services outside the Site�s standard question-and-answer platform and that may be conducted off the Site (either by phone, chat, email, remote desktop or any other third-party tool) but remain for general informational services only. Additional Services that are �Beyond Information Only� facilitate Legal, Medical, Health, Pet, and Large Animal Category Users� exchange of services that are more than informational and that could potentially evolve into a professional relationship.<br><b>Information Only Additional Services:</b><br><br>If you decide to accept Information Only Additional Services, you understand that by receiving such Additional Services, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions: (a)  Any Information Only Additional Services you receive from a legal, tax, medical or veterinary professional are for general informational purposes only.(b)  The legal, tax, medical or veterinary professional from whom you are receiving Information Only Additional Services is not acting as your attorney, tax advisor, doctor or veterinarian.(c) The legal, tax, medical or veterinary professional from whom you are receiving Information Only Additional Services may not be licensed in the jurisdiction where you are located. (d)  The Information Only Additional Services are not subject to an attorney-client/ accountant-client/doctor-patient relationship or attorney-client/ accountant-client/doctor-patient privilege.  Before applying the Information Only Additional Services to your specific situation, you should consult with a professional licensed to practice in your jurisdiction.(e)  Any amounts a Customer pays for Information Only Additional Services are divided into two distinct parts: Natural Gurus�s for enabling the request, offer and/or fulfillment of Additional Services and related services (�Additional Site Access Benefits�) and the Expert�s fee for the specific Additional Service provided to the User. Natural Gurus does not share in any Expert�s fee.(f)  Once you accept an offer for Information Only Additional Services, your payment method on file, if any, will be automatically charged the Additional Services amount. If you have already asked a question, received a response and have not yet rated the Expert, if you then proceed to accept such Expert�s offer of Additional Services, you will be deemed to have accepted the response as if you had given such Expert a �5� rating (See Section 9, Rating the Expert, above).',
